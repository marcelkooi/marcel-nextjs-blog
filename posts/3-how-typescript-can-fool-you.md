TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that allows you to add optional static typing. It's a great tool for large projects with a lot of moving parts and multiple developers making changes. It's also useful for smaller projects where you want to be more confident that the changes you're making won't blow up in production. With that said, there are some "gotchas" that I wasn't aware of with TypeScript that seem obvious to me now, but I wish I had known sooner.
